# nvim config
This is my personal [neovim](neovim.io) configuration.

Neovim 0.11+ is needed.

## Usage
Install both [ripgrep](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua-guide.html#lua-guide-config) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and add them to your path.

Clone this repository in your [nvim folder](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua-guide.html#lua-guide-config).
 - `~/.config/nivm` on macOS

Install the LSPs that will be used.
 - rust-analyser
 - typescript-language-server
 - luals
 - etc...

To check which LSPs to install, run `:LspInfo`.

Should work, enjoy!
